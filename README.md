nomad-eval-monitor
==================

*Majority of this functionality is now covered by [nomad deployments](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/commands/deployment/status.html)*


Tool to monitor the progress of a nomad evaluation.
This tool was developed to facilitate automating the orchestration of nomad jobs.

It monitors all allocations generated by the specified evaluation id, monitors all the services in the allocations, and ensures they all pass their healthchecks in consul before returning.

- `id`: the evaluation id to be monitored.
- `timeout`: How long to wait for allocations to be placed and services passing healthchecks. Default `10s` (10 seconds). Can be any valid `time.Duration` e.g `2m` (2 minutes), `2h` (2 hours). This value should be a ceiling for how long you estimate it should take your service to successfully start up.


#### Timeout Example

```bash
01:27 $ nomad run -detach example/hello.nomad
Job registration successful
Evaluation ID: 2ec19db1-7ac2-c313-55ca-854eb0774b0a

// Service failed to start up within 20s
$ ./nomad-eval-monitor -id 2ec19db1-7ac2-c313-55ca-854eb0774b0a -timeout "20s"
evaluation 2ec19db1-7ac2-c313-55ca-854eb0774b0a has 1 allocations
Allocation timed up: 473ac5dd-7c34-5448-e71d-8021b8e1bcc9
